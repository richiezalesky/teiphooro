                            <p>I don't know what to say. Assassin's Creed 3 is my favorite in the series, because to me Connor really has depth. He is constantly trying to do the right thing, even if much of what he does backfires in some way. He will never stop doing what he thinks is right. Now in Forsaken Haytham's character gets fleshed out and you see that he is trying to do the right thing for the Templars etc. It also really gave depth to him as well. When Connor made his speech about compromise in the epilogue I just finished reading the book. I recently got into assassins creed. I've played syndicate, half of AC2 (which I plan to finish), AC3, some of unity (I don't really like it, although I might finish at some point) and currently am about halfway through AC4. About the book though, I REALLY enjoyed it. Haytham is an amazing character in my opinion, and it's a shame that the game portrays him as the bad guy through Connors eyes. The first half of the book, I found to be more intriguing My friend bought me the AC: Forsaken novel for my birthday, it's a story in journal form about the life of Haytham. What I expected was that it would be a side plot and not really related to the AC3 game, what it turned out to be was a book of spoilers. The book goes more into depth of Haytham's life (you kinda see why Haytham is like he is), but all the interactions between Haytham and Connor are in the book and in most cases they're word for word from the book (including the whole first. I can't believe this is out there. http://youtu.be/FEIE_0_q_oI. Is it any good? I read the second one in the series, Assassin's Creed Renaissance and it was. Well, bad. I wasn't expecting great literature but whatever. But Forsaken is interesting to me, I really like the character of Haytham and I'd like to hear his side of the story, so is it worth I loved this book, it put Haytham a whole new light and makes him one of my favorite characters from the overall AC story line. One thing that really bugs me is the book stolen From the Kenway Manor in queen Anne's Square. They briefly mention that item was the overall goal in the raid, and Haytham said it would be the proof in the Chateau in France. However after attacking the Chateau the book was never mentioned again. What happened to it? was this the book Haytham read on the first voyage. The novel follows up after the events of AC4, but it's so goddanm sad. It was also written It starts off with Haytham as a young lad and it goes through the story all the way until Connor buries the amulet in the grave. It explains how Haytham was introduced to the creed and how he became a templar (/spoiler). It also includes the death of Edward Kenway (/spoiler) later on. Overall I think it's an interesting book and provides the thoughts of Haytham during the events in AC3. I'd recommend 
So I started reading Forsaken, I have to say the book is really well done. I'm not completely done with it yet but from what I've read, I would've have much rather played thru this story then conner's story. I would like to hear the opinion of those who read the book and what they think about.  Just a simple question to see if the storyline could be changed. A discussion on Assassins's Creed 3 and the book Assassin's Creed Forsaken (with some minor AC4:BF discussion too). I'd taken a break from the franchise after Revelations and not played a AC game in years, however I got many of the Oliver Bowden books for christmas and reading Haytham's story in Forsaken it made my play Creed 3. my thoughts after knowing both sides of the story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwmdUgl7gPk. Hi there. Well, that is a rather weird way to name the phenomenon. Anyway, when I asked if you have ever felt the "Bleeding effect", I am basically asking if you have ever been so immersed in a videogame/book/movie/series to the point where your experiences carry on with you like a halo around your conscious mind. Like how GTA players feel the urge to take random cars to go anywhere (before they realise how silly the thought was and that they aren't in GTA) or how you can resonate 
I made this list to help me catch up on Assassin's Creed for Odyssey and other upcoming games. My goal was having the modern storyline (not in a strictly chronological sense) take priority over the historical ones, while still allowing historical stories to be told in full (note the placement of the chronicles games). However, I still haven't actually played most of the stuff on this list (currently on brotherhood), so your thoughts on the accuracy of this list are much appreciated. Assassin's. A lot of people ask about the order of the games and the side media, especially comics. I used to be one of those people, so I decided to make a comprehensive list of the AC expanded universe. This is a mix of the release order, MD story order and, in some cases, historical story order, but only for media that don't have an MD story. If you have any suggestions and additions, please let me know. Edit 2: If you just want to play new games, and this is too overwhelming or something, I recomme. After days of research, checking the release dates, asking stupid questions around the AC communities, I finally came up with a chronological list to help the people getting into the series. I hope it helps :) Assassin's Creed (2007) MAIN GAME Assassin's Creed: Altair's Chronicles SPIN-OFF GAME Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines PSP SPIN-OFF GAME Assassin's Creed: The Secred Crusade BOOK Assassin's Creed: Lineage SHORT MOVIE Assassin's Creed II (2009). I see a lot of comments about wanting to see more fleshed out storylines with some of our old characters. So what could we potentially see? Altair: We've seen the end of his amazing story. Not sure there's anything left to see. Ezio: Awesome life-long story over the course of 3 games and a short film. He lived his life the best he could. Connor: Probably my least favorite of the Assassins. A lot of people want to see a continuation of his story though. I'm sure a more mature Connor I know there is a book called "Assassin's Creed: Forsaken" that recounts (among other things) Haytham's dealings with Reginald Birch. I did not read the book, but according to his page on "assassinscreed.wikia.com", Haytham seems to seek revenge for his father's death and even helps his half-sister Jennifer Scott. Now, after learning how his father was killed and how his introduction to the templar order was affected by lies, I wonder why he remains in the templar order and how come the death. 
Hey there, I just noticed that I have a copy of Assassins Creed Forsaken. I'd consider myself a well-read person; are the novels any good, technically, storywise, or otherwise? I'm curious but I don't want to waste my time or anything. And so it begins! The first edition of the newly revamped Weekly Discussion Thread is now here, and we're going to start with the most controversial Assassin to date. ###THIS THREAD WILL HAVE SPOILERS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED --- Biographical information Name: Ratonhnhaké:ton (Connor Kenway) Born: April 4, 1756 Kanatahséton, Mohawk Valley Appears in: Assassin's Creed III Assassin's Creed: Forsaken Assassin's Creed III: Liberation Voice Actor: Noah Watts I'm going to make a list of everything Assassin's Creed across all media in chronological order. This will include games, novels, comics, spin-offs, movies and anything else. This isn't a final list, so please correct me if I misplaced anything and tell me if I missed anything. { SPIN-OFF } Assassin's Creed: Altair's Chronicles { COMIC } Assassin's Creed { WEBCOMIC } Assassin's Creed { GAME } Assassin's Creed { SPIN-OFF } Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines { ANIMATION } Assassin's. Q: For the best ongoing narrative experience, should I play Rogue or Unity first. gt A: Each are unique narratives, so both have different advantages. Q: will there me multiple outfits as in other AC's? gt A: Yes, there will be. Shay will have a variety of outfits. Q: Can you tell us anything about the modern day story? gt A: We can't say anything about that, except that there will be modern day. It exists. Q: Will Rogue expand on Black Flag's naval system?. New things that we learn from The Assassin's Den - featuring Richard Farrese. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aNOdYDnogk Warning- Full Spoilers for Assassin's Creed Rogue, Forsaken and Chronicles China below! Special Thanks to Loomer for creating such a great podcast! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - James Nadiger wrote the majority of Modern Day in Assassin's Creed Syndicate. - It was decided early on in the development. I usually prefer audiobooks because I can listen to them in the car, while walking or in public transportation. So far I found all of the following books on Audible, except AC:Unity Assassin's Creed: Renaissance Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood Assassin's Creed: The Secret Crusade Assassin's Creed: Revelations Assassin's Creed: Forsaken Assassin's Creed: Black Flag Assassin's Creed: Unity Assassin's Creed: Underworld I'm thinking it might be region restricted. Im currently reading Assassin's Creed: Forsaken, so far its been really interesting. And it gave me a great idea for a game-setting. Playing as a 20 year old Haytham travelling Europe. It could show a lot about the Templar Order and how they run things. And he seems to visit some really cool places. </p>
